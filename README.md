# Detection of Early stages of Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD)

Aim of this project is to detect Chronic Kidney Disease.
We have collected the data from kidney_disease.csv dataset and performed the necessary preprocessing.
We then build different ML models and finally check their accuracy.
Some of the models resulted in overfitting hence they have been discarded.

Models which performed well:
1.Random Forest Classifier with accuracy of	0.991667
2.Ada Boost Classifier with accuracy of	0.991667
3.XGBoost	with accuracy of 0.991667
4.CatBoostwith accuracy of 0.991667
5.Decision Tree Classifier with accuracy of	0.958333
