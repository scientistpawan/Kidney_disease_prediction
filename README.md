# Detection of Early stages of Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD)

Aim of this project is to detect Chronic Kidney Disease.
We have collected the data from kidney_disease.csv dataset and performed the necessary preprocessing.
We then build different ML models and finally check their accuracy.
Some of the models resulted in overfitting hence they have been discarded.

Models which performed well:
Random Forest Classifier with accuracy of	0.991667
Ada Boost Classifier with accuracy of	0.991667
XGBoost	with accuracy of 0.991667
CatBoostwith accuracy of 0.991667
Decision Tree Classifier with accuracy of	0.958333
